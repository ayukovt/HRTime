# Pull Request

Include:

- A mention of an issue with HRTime (ex bug with existing code, code that can be improved, support for additional features you're adding, etc).
- Testing of your PR, if viable.
- If optimization, specs of your test computers, A speed test for the original and your new PR, and your times for both the original and your PR is recommended, but if you can showcase it being faster in another way (or if it's just plain obvious it is) then we still will accept the PR.
- Code that is legally allowed to be open source and is able to be on here.
- Even if not optimization, mention what OS you developed on, such as Linux / Windows. (Note that currently only a Windows version is available so this is not needed at the moment).
